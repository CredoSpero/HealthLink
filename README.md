# HealthLink Web Application

## Context

This web application was built for the project component of CZ2006 Software Engineering module taken in NTU

## Coursework Group Project

- Implemented web application deployed on Heroku server along with five other team members.
- Included features such as enabling users to input their symptoms and getting a preliminary diagnosis of their condition using machine learning
- Implemented other features in the app such as finding nearby healthcare facilties and their information as well as a queue management system for users to join the respective hospital queue
- Enabled the diagnosis prediction by deploying the machine learning model on a `flask server` which is deployed on `Heroku`
- Enabled searching for nearby hospital and getting directions to hospital by utilizing real-time data retrieval using `Geocode API` and `Directions API` from Google
- The storage of the Hospital queue information is remote and implemented with `MongoDB Atlas multi-cloud database`.
- The web application utilises a MERN stack, which is deployed on `Heroku` server.
